          Hi there! I'm Jeuan Mitchell, and I created this message board as part
          of my coursework at SDGKU.
        </p>
        <p>
          This project represents my journey into web development using Django
          and modern web technologies. As a student, I wanted to build something
          that demonstrates both technical skills and practical application of
          what I've learned in class.
        </p>
        <p>
          The message board serves as a project submission, showcasing
          everything from database design and user authentication to responsive
          web design and clean, maintainable code.
        </p>
        <p class="mb-0">
          Thanks for checking out my work! I hope this message board serves as a
          useful platform for communication and demonstrates my growing skills
          as a developer. 😊
        </p>
